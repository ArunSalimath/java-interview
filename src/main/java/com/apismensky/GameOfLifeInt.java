/**
 * The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
 * each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated"
 * (the difference may seem minor, except when viewing it as an early model of human/urban behaviour
 * simulation or how one views a blank space on a grid). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours,
 * which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
 * At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
 * - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
 * - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 * - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 * - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.
 * The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the
 * seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens
 * is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one).
 * The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
